# Book Image Loading Optimization

## Problem
The original implementation was fetching all book images from Google Drive synchronously, causing the entire page to wait until all images were downloaded before showing any content. This resulted in poor user experience with long loading times.

## Solution
Implemented lazy loading with the following optimizations:

### 1. LazyImage Component (`src/components/LazyImage.jsx`)
- **Intersection Observer**: Only loads images when they come into view
- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner while image is being fetched
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles failed image loads with fallback
- **Preloading**: Starts loading 50px before image comes into view for smoother experience

### 2. Optimized fetchBooks Function
- **Immediate Data Display**: Shows book details immediately with placeholder images
- **Separate Image Loading**: Images are loaded separately and asynchronously
- **No Blocking**: Page content appears instantly, images load progressively

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Loading Indicators**: Clear visual feedback during loading states
- **Progressive Loading**: Book details appear first, images load as user scrolls
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade-in effects when images finish loading

## Benefits
1. **Faster Initial Load**: Page content appears immediately
2. **Better Performance**: Only loads images that are visible
3. **Improved UX**: Users can see and interact with content while images load
4. **Bandwidth Efficient**: Reduces unnecessary image downloads
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Better performance on slower connections

## Usage
The LazyImage component automatically handles:
- Lazy loading when images come into view
- Loading animations
- Error states with fallback images
- Smooth transitions

No changes needed in existing code - just replace `<img>` tags with `<LazyImage>` components.

## Technical Details
- Uses Intersection Observer API for efficient viewport detection
- Implements proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Handles both direct image URLs and Google Drive file fetching
- Includes proper error boundaries and fallback mechanisms
